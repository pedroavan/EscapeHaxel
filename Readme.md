A very old game project, an infinite runner originally made with [Flixel](https://github.com/AdamAtomic/flixel).

Just recently I decided to port it to [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/), as Flash is now obsolete, ande release it as open source.

You can play it in your browser [here](https://pavanz.itch.io/escape)!
